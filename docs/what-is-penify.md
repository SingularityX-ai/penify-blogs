# What's Penify?

Penify is an intelligent GitHub App designed to automate the process of generating and updating documentation for GitHub projects. 

It activates automatically after installation, tracking changes every time a pull request is merged. Penify recognizes new classes and functions in the code and crafts or updates documentation accordingly, creating a PR for review before merging.

This tool saves time, ensures documentation consistency, and simplifies onboarding for new team members by keeping documentation in sync with code changes. It's ideal for startups, large teams, and open source projects.
