- If either of them is missing, you need to install the [Penify App](https://github.com/apps/penify-dev) again.

## ‚öôÔ∏è GitHub Workflow Issues

### üõ†Ô∏è Problem: Workflow File Not Committed

**Symptoms:**

- The workflow file `snorkell-auto-documentation.yml` is not appearing in the `.github/workflows` directory.
- No pull request is created for the workflow file.

**Solutions:**

1. **‚úÖ Check Pull Request:**
   - Ensure that the Penify app installation process has completed successfully. It will create a Pull Request with the name - `[Penify]: Setting up Automated AI-Driven Documentation for GitHub!`
   - If the PR is open, please merge the Pull Request to add the workflow file to your repository.
2. **üîç Manual Workflow File Check:**
   - Verify if the workflow file `snorkell-auto-documentation.yml` exists in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
3. **üìù Check the Content of the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure the content of the workflow file is correct. It should include the necessary configurations for the Snorkell documentation generation process.
   - Verify that placeholders such as `:::BRANCH_NAME:::` are replaced with the appropriate base branch name. The content should resemble the following template:

     ```yaml
      name: Penify - Revolutionizing Documentation on GitHub
      
      on:
         push:
         branches: [":::BRANCH_NAME:::"]
         workflow_dispatch:
      
      jobs:
         Documentation:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
         - name: Penify DocGen Client
            uses: SingularityX-ai/snorkell-documentation-client@v1.0.0
            with:
               client_id: ${{ secrets.SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID }}
               api_key: ${{ secrets.SNORKELL_API_KEY }}
               branch_name: "main"
      ```

   - If the above file is not present, please create a file `.github/workflows/snorkell-auto-documentation.yml` and add the above content.

4. **üîê Repository Permissions:**
   - Ensure that the Penify app has the necessary permissions to write to the repository. Check the repository settings under `Settings > Integrations > Installed GitHub Apps`.

### üöÄ Problem: Workflow Not Triggering

**Symptoms:**

- The workflow does not trigger after merging the pull request.
- No automated documentation is generated.

**Solutions:**

1. **‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Activation:**
   - Ensure that the workflow is enabled in the `Actions` tab of your GitHub repository.
   - Url format would be - https://github.com/{org_name}/{repo_name}/actions/

2. **üîß Repository Settings:**
   - Ensure that GitHub Actions are enabled for your repository. Check the Github Actions are getting triggered or not  

## üîê GitHub Secrets Issues

### üõ†Ô∏è Problem: Secrets Not Set

**Symptoms:**

- The necessary secrets (`SNORKELL_API_KEY` and `SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID`) are not present in the repository settings.
- Workflow fails due to missing secrets.

**Solutions:**

1. **üîë Manual Secret Addition:**
   - Manually add the secrets to your repository settings. Navigate to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions` and add `SNORKELL_API_KEY` and `SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID` with the appropriate values.
2. **üîç Secrets keys are not present or incorrect:**
   - If the secret `SNORKELL_API_KEY` is not present, go to [Penify API Keys](https://dashboard.penify.dev/penify-api-keys) generate a secret key and add the value in the content section.
   - If the secret `SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID` is not present.
     - Go to [Penify Dashboard](https://dashboard.penify.dev/documentation-generator-dashboard)
     - Select your repository
     - Check the url - `https://dashboard.penify.dev/documentation-generator-dashboard/{org_name}/{repo_name}?id={client_id}`
     - `client_id` is your `SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID`
     - Don't worry this `SNORKELL_CLIENT_ID` is not actually a secret and can easily be shared.
