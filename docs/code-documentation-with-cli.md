## The Documentation Dilemma

We've all been there - staring at a piece of code, trying to decipher what it does and why it was written that way. Good documentation is the unsung hero of software development, playing a crucial role in:

1. Onboarding new team members
2. Maintaining and updating existing code
3. Facilitating collaboration among developers
4. Preserving knowledge as team members come and go

But let's face it, writing documentation is often seen as a chore. That's where Penify-CLI comes in.

## Introducing Penify-CLI

Penify-CLI is not just another documentation tool. It's your personal documentation assistant, powered by advanced AI to understand your code and generate meaningful documentation.
